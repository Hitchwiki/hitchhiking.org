# hitchhiking.org

This is a temporary placeholder page.  We got hitchhiking.org.

Now we should probably do something nice with it.  One idea is to set up a nostr based forum, in the spirit of [nostroots](https://github.com/Trustroots/nostroots).


Some of our projects:

* https://hitchwiki.org/
* https://trashwiki.org/
* https://trustroots.org/

We also have

* https://rideshares.org/
* https://randomroads.org/
