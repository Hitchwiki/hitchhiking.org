# hitchhiking.org

This is a temporary placeholder page.  We got hitchhiking.org.

Now we should probably do something nice with this domain.  One idea is to set up a [nostr based forum](https://github.com/Hitchwiki/hitchhiking.org/issues), in the spirit of [nostroots](https://github.com/Trustroots/nostroots).
Other ideas are [welcome](https://github.com/Hitchwiki/hitchhiking.org/issues/new).

Some of our projects:

* [hitchwiki](https://hitchwiki.org/), since 2004/2006
* [trashwiki](https://trashwiki.org/), since 2008
* [trustroots](https://trustroots.org/), since 2014
* [hitchmap](https://hitchmap.com/)
* [rideshares.org](https://rideshares.org/), nostr based rideshares application https://github.com/kenflannery/rideshares-nostr, since May 2025
* [randomroads.org](https://randomroads.org/), a magazine about independent forms of traveling, not actively maintained since 2015 or so
