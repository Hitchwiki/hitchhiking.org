# hitchhiking.org

This is a temporary placeholder page.  We got hitchhiking.org.

Now we should probably do something nice with this domain.  One idea is to set up a [nostr based forum](https://github.com/Hitchwiki/hitchhiking.org/issues), in the spirit of [nostroots](https://github.com/Trustroots/nostroots).
Other ideas are [welcome](https://github.com/Hitchwiki/hitchhiking.org/issues/new).

Some of our projects:

* [hitchwiki](https://hitchwiki.org/)
* [trashwiki](https://trashwiki.org/)
* [trustroots](https://trustroots.org/)

We also have

* [rideshares.org](https://rideshares.org/)
* [randomroads.org](https://randomroads.org/)
