This is a temporary placeholder page.  We want to do something nice with the hitchhiking.org domain.  [Ideas](https://github.com/Hitchwiki/hitchhiking.org/issues):
- set up a [nostr based forum](https://github.com/Hitchwiki/hitchhiking.org/issues), in the spirit of [nostroots](https://github.com/Trustroots/nostroots).
- [restore digihitch](https://github.com/Hitchwiki/hitchhiking.org/issues/3)
- [ai.hitchhiking.org](https://github.com/Hitchwiki/hitchhiking.org/issues/4)

More ideas are [welcome](https://github.com/Hitchwiki/hitchhiking.org/issues/new).
